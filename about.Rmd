Alice Lampard was brought up at Mandinam, Llangadog - a small estate of three farms with hill grazing and woodland where the family added a suckler herd and an intensive lowland flock. Latterly, Mandinam has greatly reduced the stock enterprise and focused more on the woodland and tourism sectors associated with land ownership.
<br><br>
In 2016 Alice embarked upon developing her coaching skills and has gained an Advanced Accredited Diploma in coaching from the Centre for Coaching, studying at the British Psychological Institute in London. She is also an accredited mediator gaining her qualification with CEDR in August 2017 studying in Barcelona. Alice regularly attends both national and international coaching conferences maintaining a fresh outlook and as a member of the International Society for Coaching Psychology and the Association for Coaching works to their standards of code of conduct and ethics.
<br><br>
With a private practice coaching across sectors, Alice also works with The Prince’s Countryside Fund, Farming Connect, and enjoys being a guest lecturer for the Coaching and Mentoring module at Aberystwyth University. With past experience as a co-director of a family construction firm, writing articles for pedigree breed journals and an active member of the CLA involved with the Polisi Cymru and UK Agriculture & Land Use committees she brings a wealth of experience to her role.
